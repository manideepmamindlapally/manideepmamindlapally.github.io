# Reading group MIP\*=RE

Welcome! This is a reading group to understand the celebrated recent result by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen ([arXiv:2001.04383](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383)) and some of its precursor works. Our focus is to understand the material from a computer science perspective, so we only delve into the details of operator algebras if needed. We expect participants to have some familiarity with undergrad-level complexity theory and quantum information, although not necessary.

This group is organised by [Pranab Sen (TIFR)](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~pgdsen/) and [Upendra Kapshikar (NUS)](https://www.quantumlah.org/people/profile/Upendra) and me, [Manideep Mamindlapally]({{ site.baseurl }}). We plan to conduct it as a webinar series on Zoom, so participants from anywhere in the world can join. Please mail me (manideepyx[at]gmail[dot]com) or Pranab or Upendra if you are interested.
