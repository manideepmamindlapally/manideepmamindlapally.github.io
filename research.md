## Security and Privacy - The Commitment Problem
Commitment is a cryptographic protocol. To understand it think of an example. Courtesy [[_Winter 'et al. '03_ ](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0304014)]. Say there are two kids, Alice and Bob, playing a game of chess. It gets night and they decide to continue the game in the morning from the same position they leave off. However, there is one concern. If a player, say Bob were to play the last move in the night, Alice would have an entire night to think over her next move. This makes the game unfair. To do away with this problem we can ask Alice to think and write down his next move on an envelope and seal it off in the night itself.
