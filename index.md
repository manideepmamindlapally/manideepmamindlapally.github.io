Hello there, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, and I am currently a dual-degree(Bachelors+Masters) student at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science research. More specifically in
-	Information Theory
-	Cryptography
-	Quantum Information Theory
-	Quantum Computation

I have been doing a fair bit of research in these topics, working on different projects with [_Prof. Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556), [_Prof. Ligong Wong_](https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/ligong.wang/), [_Prof. Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html). Check out more about the work on the [Research](reasearch) tab.

On this webpage here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications](publications) tab. To get a better insight into my life so far have a look at my [curriculum vitae](CV/cv.pdf). Or read an informal bio [about](about) me. I plan on writing any ideas or thoughts that occur to me on this [blog](blog") here as well.
