Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, and I am currently a dual-degree(Bachelors+Masters)student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. I am interested and have been doing a fair bit of research in Information Theory, Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computation. I am actually now looking to apply for doctoral positions in these fields for Fall 2022.

I just recently made this webpage. Here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications]("{{ site.baseurl }}/publications") tab. To get a better insight into my life so far, you can have a look at my [curriculum vitae]("{{ site.baseurl }}/CV"). I plan on writing any ideas or thoughts that occur to me on this [blog]("{{ site.baseurl }}/blog") here as well.
