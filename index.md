Hello there, welcome to my webpage! :D

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, pronounced "ma-ni-dheep ma-min-la-pa-lly" or simply call me "Mani". I'll respond. I am currently a Junior Research Fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, India, where I am working with [_Akshayaram Srinivasan_](https://www.tifr.res.in/~akshayaram.srinivasan/). Recently, I graduated from a dual-degree (5 yr. Bachelors + Masters) programme at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India where I was supervised by [_Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html). My research interests are broadly in theoretical computer science. More specifically I have been interested and am doing a fair bit of research in
- Quantum Complexity Theory
- Quantum Information Theory
-	Information Theory
- Cryptography

while working on different projects with [_Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html), [_Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556), [_Ligong Wang_](https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/ligong.wang/) and [_Akshayaram Srinivasan_](https://www.tifr.res.in/~akshayaram.srinivasan/) and exploring some topics independently. Check out more on the [Research](research) tab. 

Thanks to some sweet people, I got the opportunity to travel, give invited guest talks and seminar talks at some places (See more on [Talks](talks) tab). I have been a reviewer for ITW 2022 conference and TransIT journal. On this webpage here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications](publications) tab. To get a better insight into my life so far have a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](CV). Click on the bubbles at the bottom of the page for my academic and other social links.

Outside of Academic life, I often find myself engrossed in drawing. I always enjoyed scribbling doodles and cartoons on the corners of my class notes. Recently, I started doing digital art which I am uploading on Instagram [@manideep_doodles](https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}). You can also check out the [Art](art) tab. I am a big fan of some Shounen anime/manga series, such as "One Piece" which I religiously follow. It has influenced my life in many ways. The photo above here is me cosplaying as Monkey D Luffy, the series' protagonist.

[<i>Nov '22</i>] Attended ITW 2022 held at IIT Bombay, where I presented my paper on "Commitment over Unreliable Channels: When Awareness meets Control". I also volunteered for the first time at a conference. Assisting chairs, organising events and meeting lots of academics. It was fun and went mostly smooth, except for a couple of embarassing stints :).<br/> <br/>

[<i>Oct '22</i>] Reviewed a journal paper now for the first time. Just submitted a review to IEEE Transactions in Information Theory. Proud to be part of the peer-review process.<br/> <br/>

[<i>Oct '22</i>] Joined as a JRF at TIFR, Mumbai. Working on a security problem in Multi party computaion with Akshayaram Srinivasan. Lovely place and great people! I am getting to attend a ton of interesting lectures and colloqium talks.<br/> <br/>

[<i>Aug '22</i>] Started giving a series of (online) seminar talks on a couple of previous works on "Classical Verification of Quantum Computations" to Rahul Jain's group at CQT, NUS, Singapore. (Notes under the Talks tab)<br/> <br/>

[<i>Jul '22</i>] Gave an invited seminar talk "On unconditionally secure commitment over unreliable noisy channels" (my masters thesis) at TUM, Germany. Many thanks to travel support from TUM and Andreas!<br/><br/>

[<i>Jun '22</i>] Presented my work (with Andreas) "Singleton bounds for entanglement assisted classical quantum error correcting codes" at ISIT 2022 conference held at Helsinki, Finland. My first physical attendance at an international conference. Infact, my first international travel ever! Thanks to travel support from Andreas and ISIT.<br/><br/>

[<i>Jun '22</i>] Joined as a reviewer for the IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW) 2022 conference. This is the first time I ever reviewed!<br/><br/>

[<i>Jan '22</i>] Won the best paper award in the Graduate Forum event at COMSNETS '22 conference. Extremely thrilled to hear! Many thanks to my supervisor Amitalok and other collaborators Anuj and Pranav. It is my first physical attendance at an academic conference. <br/><br/>

[<i>Dec '21</i>] Received the Nilanjan Ganguly Memorial Award for the best Bachelor Thesis in my cohort for session 2020-21. Greatly honoured! Many thanks to my supervisor Amitalok and other collaborators Anuj, Pranav, and Manoj. <br/><br/>

[<i>Dec '21</i>] Paper "On reverse elastic channels and the asymmetry of commitment capacity under channel elasticity" got accepted at JSAC 2021. This will be my first journal publication! Many thanks and congrats to co-authors! <br/><br/>

[<i>Nov '21</i>] Paper "On Commitment over General Compound Channels" got accepted at COMSNETS 2022. Many thanks and congrats to co-authors! <br/><br/>

[<i>Oct '21</i>] All done! This website is up and running now. Stay tuned here for updates. <br/><br/>

[<i>Sep '21</i>] Paper "On the Commitment Capacity of Reverse Elastic Channels" got accepted at ITW 2021. Many thanks and congrats to co-authors! <br/><br/>
