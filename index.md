Hello there, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally. I recently graduated from a dual-degree (5 yr. Bachelors + Masters) programme at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India. My research interests are broadly in theoretical computer science. More specifically I have been interested and am doing a fair bit of research in
- Quantum Complexity Theory
- Quantum Information Theory
-	Information Theory
- Complexity Theory

while working on different projects with [_Prof. Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556), [_Prof. Ligong Wang_](https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/ligong.wang/) and [_Prof. Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html) and exploring few other research topics independently. Check out more on the [Research](research) tab. 

On this webpage here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications](publications) tab. To get a better insight into my life so far have a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](CV). Click on the bubbles at the bottom of the page for my academic and other social links.
