Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, and I am currently a dual-degree(Bachelors+Masters) student at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science research. More specifically in
-	Information Theory
-	Cryptography
-	Quantum Information Theory
-	Quantum Computation

I have been doing a fair bit of research in these topics, working on different projects with [_Prof. Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556), [_Prof. Ligong Wong_](https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/ligong.wang/), [_Prof. Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html). Check out more about them on the Research tab.

I just recently made this webpage. Here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications]("{{ site.baseurl }}/publications") tab. To get a better insight into my life so far, you can have a look at my [curriculum vitae]("{{ site.baseurl }}/CV"). I plan on writing any ideas or thoughts that occur to me on this [blog]("{{ site.baseurl }}" + "/blog") here as well.
