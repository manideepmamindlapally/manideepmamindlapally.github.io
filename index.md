Hello there, welcome to my homepage!

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally. I am currently a final year dual-degree (Bachelors + Masters) student at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India. My research interests are broadly in theoretical computer science. More specifically I have been interested and doing a fair bit of research in
-	Information Theory
-	Cryptography
-	Quantum Information Theory
-	Quantum Computation

while working on different projects with [_Prof. Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556), [_Prof. Ligong Wong_](https://perso-etis.ensea.fr/ligong.wang/) and [_Prof. Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html). Check out more on the [Research](reasearch) tab.

On this webpage here, I maintain a list of my publications under the [Publications](publications) tab. To get a better insight into my life so far have a look at my [Curriculum Citae](CV). Or read an informal bio [about](about) me. I plan on writing any ideas or thoughts that occur to me on this [blog](blog) here as well.
