Hello there, welcome to my webpage! :D

My name is Manideep Mamindlapally, pronounced "ma-ni-dheep ma-min-la-pa-lly" or simply call me "Mani". 
I'll respond. 
I am currently a first year PhD student working at QuSoft in CWI (Centrum Wiskunde Mathematica), The Netherlands (Although I am technically employed by the University of Amseterdam which is across the street.) 
I am co-supervised by  [_Stacey Jeffery_](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jeffery/) and [_Florian Speelmann_](https://www.cwi.nl/en/people/florian-speelman/).

Prior to joining QuSoft, I worked for a few months as a Junior Research Fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, India, with [_Pranab Sen_](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~pgdsen/) and [_Akshayaram Srinivasan_](https://www.tifr.res.in/~akshayaram.srinivasan/). 
Before that I had done a dual-degree (5 yr. Bachelors + Masters) programme in Electronics engineering at **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**, India where I was supervised by [_Amitalok J Budkuley_](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/index.html). 
During my final year, I worked with [_Andreas Winter_](https://www.icrea.cat/en/Web/ScientificStaff/awinter-556) on a summer project.

I got introduced to academic research through my undergrad research in an Information Theoretic problem called "Commitment" for my bachelor thesis and then through a summer project in Quantum Information Theory.
I had breifly studied some classical cryptography works, quantum interactive proofs and non-local games during my stay at TIFR.

Currently at QuSoft, I am working on a couple of Quantum Algorthimic problems. Although I am still continuing to explore and am on the look out for interesting problems in Quantum Cryptography as well. 

Outside of Academic life, I often find myself engrossed in drawing. I always enjoyed scribbling doodles and cartoons on the corners of my class notes. Recently, I started doing digital art which I am uploading on Instagram [@manideep_doodles](https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.instagram }}). You can also check out the [Art](art) tab. I am a big fan of some Shounen anime/manga series, such as "One Piece" which I religiously follow. The photo above here is me cosplaying as Monkey D Luffy, the series' protagonist.

It was fun and went mostly smooth, except for a couple of embarassing stints :).<br/> <br/>

[<i>Oct '22</i>] Reviewed a journal paper now for the first time. Just submitted a review to IEEE Transactions in Information Theory. Proud to be part of the peer-review process.<br/> <br/>

[<i>Oct '22</i>] Joined as a JRF at TIFR, Mumbai. Working on a security problem in Multi party computaion with Akshayaram Srinivasan. Lovely place and great people! I am getting to attend a ton of interesting lectures and colloqium talks.<br/> <br/>

[<i>Aug '22</i>] Started giving a series of (online) seminar talks on a couple of previous works on "Classical Verification of Quantum Computations" to Rahul Jain's group at CQT, NUS, Singapore. (Notes under the Talks tab)<br/> <br/>

My first physical attendance at an international conference. Infact, my first international travel ever! Thanks to travel support from Andreas and ISIT.<br/><br/>

[<i>Jun '22</i>] Joined as a reviewer for the IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW) 2022 conference. This is the first time I ever reviewed!<br/><br/>

[<i>Jan '22</i>] Won the best paper award in the Graduate Forum event at COMSNETS '22 conference. Extremely thrilled to hear! Many thanks to my supervisor Amitalok and other collaborators Anuj and Pranav. It is my first physical attendance at an academic conference. <br/><br/>

[<i>Dec '21</i>] Received the Nilanjan Ganguly Memorial Award for the best Bachelor Thesis in my cohort for session 2020-21. Greatly honoured! Many thanks to my supervisor Amitalok and other collaborators Anuj, Pranav, and Manoj. <br/><br/>

[<i>Dec '21</i>] Paper "On reverse elastic channels and the asymmetry of commitment capacity under channel elasticity" got accepted at JSAC 2021. This will be my first journal publication! Many thanks and congrats to co-authors! <br/><br/>

[<i>Nov '21</i>] Paper "On Commitment over General Compound Channels" got accepted at COMSNETS 2022. Many thanks and congrats to co-authors! <br/><br/>

[<i>Oct '21</i>] All done! This website is up and running now. Stay tuned here for updates. <br/><br/>
